# startup_namer

Simple app that generates proposed names for a startup company. The user can select and unselect names, saving the best ones. The code lazily generates 10 names at a time. As the user scrolls, more names are generated. There is no limit to how far a user can scroll.

## Notes

1. The itemBuilder callback is called once per suggested word pairing, and places each suggestion into a ListTile row. For even rows, the function adds a ListTile row for the word pairing. For odd rows, the function adds a Divider widget to visually separate the entries. Note that the divider might be difficult to see on smaller devices.

2. Add a one-pixel-high divider widget before each row in the ListView.

3. The expression i ~/ 2 divides i by 2 and returns an integer result. For example: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 becomes 0, 1, 1, 2, 2. This calculates the actual number of word pairings in the ListView, minus the divider widgets.

4. If youâ€™ve reached the end of the available word pairings, then generate 10 more and add them to the suggestions list.
